# Design Goals

Many monsters have resistances to damage types, conditions, or certain effects. However, currently the only weakness that is commonly utilised is that of damage types, causing creatures to take twice as much damage of the listed type, a fault so severe that it is omitted from almost all stat blocks in D&D 5th Edition. The weaknesses listed below are less severe and will inspire more tactical play from the adventuring party, as well as rewarding careful planning and quick thinking. A significant side-effect of these weaknesses are that they indirectly empower martial characters, as many of the weaknesses can be more easily exploited by classes such as Rogues and Fighters. This can help to mitigate some of the power discrepancy felt between martial and spellcasting classes, particularly at higher levels of play.

**New Conditions**

To create more granular effects that players can exploit, many of the weaknesses outlined here make use of two new conditions: off-balance, and unnerved.

***Off-Balance.*** When an off-balance creature takes damage from a creature, it takes additional damage of the same type equal to the proficiency bonus of the attacker (if there are multiple damage types, the attacker chooses one of them to apply).

***Unnerved.*** An unnerved creature suffers a -2 penalty to its AC. If an unnerved creature uses its action on its turn to attack, it suffers a cumulative -2 penalty to each attack roll it makes after its first. This penalty resets at the end of each of the creature’s turns.

# Types of Weaknesses

Weaknesses can be broadly separated into the following three categories: aversions, weak spots, and vulnerabilities.

**Aversion**

A creature with an aversion cannot abide a certain object, image, sound or other phenomena. An opponent that is aware of a creature’s aversion can present the source of its aversion to it by using an action. When confronted with the source of their aversion, the creature must succeed on a Wisdom saving throw. The DC equals 10 plus the proficiency bonus of the creature that is presenting the source. On a failed save, the creature with the aversion becomes unnerved until it can no longer perceive the source. An unnerved creature can reroll the saving throw at the end of each of its turns, ending the condition on a success. At the DM's discretion, failing the saving throw could trigger a different effect, such as psychic damage or the stunned condition.

**Weak Spot**

A creature with a weak spot has a particularly soft, brittle or otherwise flawed part of its body that is especially painful if hit. A weak spot can be identified with a successful Wisdom (Insight) check. The DC equals 10 + the Challenge Rating of the creature being observed (rounded up). Once identified, an opponent can choose to aim its attacks on the creature’s weak spot. If it does, the opponent’s attack roll suffers a penalty equal to the target creature’s proficiency bonus. If the attack roll hits the weak spot, the creature suffers an additional 1d6 damage of the attack’s type (the attacker’s choice, if there is more than one type of damage dealt), as well as gaining one of the following conditions, depending on the area of the weak spot:

***Head.*** The creature is unnerved until the end of its next turn. If it is already unnerved, it instead becomes frightened of the attacking creature for the same duration.

***Legs.*** The creature is off-balance until the end of its next turn. If it is already off-balance, it instead falls prone.

***Torso.*** The creature gains one level of exhaustion.

For non-bipedal creatures, other weak spots that are more appropriate to the creature’s physiology can be implemented, and it might be suitable that the effect of hitting a weak spot could have more long-lasting consequences, such as a creature losing its Multiattack feature if one of its limbs is struck.

**Vulnerability**

A creature with a vulnerability is particularly affected by certain types of damage or materials. When the creature takes damage of the type it is vulnerable to, or from a weapon made of the material it is vulnerable to, it takes an additional 1d6 damage of that type, and also suffers one of the following effects as appropriate to the type.

At the DM's discretion, more or less severe effects could be applied as part of a vulnerability. For more challenging creatures, the amount of additional damage could be increased, or the additional effects listed below could be applied for a longer period of time (perhaps even permanently).

*Damage Type Effects*

| Type | Effect |

**Acid** | The creature’s AC is reduced by -2 until the start of its next turn.

**Bludgeoning** | The creature is dazed, and becomes off-balance until the end of its next turn.

**Cold** | The creature freezes up, and its speed is halved until the end of its next turn.

**Fire** | The creature sets alight, and immediately takes a further 1d4 fire damage.

**Force** | The creature is pushed 5 feet away from the source of the force damage.

**Lightning** | The creature is shaken, and becomes off-balance until the end of its next turn.

**Necrotic** | The creature’s flesh rots, and immediately takes a further 1d4 necrotic damage.

**Poison** | The creature is poisoned until the start of its next turn.

**Piercing** | The creature is winded, and its speed is halved until the end of its next turn.

**Psychic** | The creature is shaken, and becomes unnerved until the end of its next turn.

**Radiant** | The creature is blinded until the start of its next turn.

**Slashing** | The creature bleeds, and immediately takes a further 1d4 slashing damage.

**Thunder** | The creature is deafened until the end of its next turn.

*Weapon Material Effects*

| Material | Effect |

**Adamantine** | The creature is winded, becoming off-balance until the end of its next turn. Constructs are frequently vulnerable to this material.

**Ebony** | The creature's fly speed, if it has one, is halved until the end of its next turn. Celestials are frequently vulnerable to this material.

**Iron** | If the creature is a shapeshifter, it reverts to its true form. Fey are frequently vulnerable to this material.

**Mithril** | The creature is shaken, and becomes unnerved until the end of its next turn. Aberrations are frequently vulnerable to this material.

**Obsidian** | The creature becomes vulnerable to fire until the end of its next turn. Plants are frequently vulnerable to this material.

**Sanctus** | The creature is blinded until the start of its next turn. Fiends and undead are frequently vulnerable to this material.

**Silver** | If the creature is a shapeshifter, it reverts to its true form. Shapeshifters are frequently vulnerable to this material.

**Titanium** | The creature is winded, becoming off-balance until the end of its next turn. Giants are frequently vulnerable to this material.

*Note on Weapon Materials*

The vulnerabilities here make use of new weapon materials, such as mithril and sanctus. Some materials, like silver, do have representation in the DMG, but even then they are rarely used. The expanded materials here can further enrich the experience of martial characters, who can now research their foes and prepare themselves with weapons of the correct material ahead of time.

Sanctus is a homebrew material. It is a type of iron that forms when an iron ore deposit becomes consecrated, either purposefully or by accident. When combined with carbon, it becomes sanctus steel, a material that undead and fiend type creatures abhor.
