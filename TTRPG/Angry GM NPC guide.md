1. Define the NPC's game purpose in a short sentence.
2. Give the NPC precisely two humanizing traits.
3. Use self-awareness and challenges, growth, and agency for protagonists and supporting characters with lots of screen time.
4. Use vulnerability, fear, and pain for object NPCs and quest-giver NPCs who need help.
5. Use hopeful-type traits like hopes, dreams, and aspirations for the same NPCs as suffering-type traits but more positive.
6. Adjust the mix of suffering-type and hopeful-type traits to create a tone that suits your game world.
7. Use values, virtues, and beliefs for any NPC that needs to work with or oppose the players.
8. Flaws and failings are best used for villains, enemies, obstacles or tragic heroes combined with self-awareness, agency, growth or virtue-type traits to make them more complex.
9. Be careful not to use too many pitiable extras as it may create a feeling that people you're saving aren't worth helping.
10. As time goes on, NPCs can earn or develop more traits making them more complex.

Note: Avoid using sympathetic villain trope unless necessary as it tends to absolve the villain of responsibility for their choices implying they were just victims without choice creating an interesting moral dilemma about how heroes and societies can accidentally create their own villains but may also affect the game's morality and agency negatively if overused or misused.
